    <title>A Basic HTML page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome world!</h1>
    <p>This is in a pargraph writing in a paragraph tag  
    </p>
    <p>And this is another paragraph i'm writing which is't helpful
        to anyone otherthan me.
    </p>
    <h6>The h6 heading tag</h6>
    <p>we can make the text bold in our paragraphs with the strong tag.
        The below sentence is written using a strong tag.
        <strong>Bold Text</strong>
    </p>
    <p>We can also use The bold text in the middle of a <strong>paragraph</strong></p>
    <p>
        If there is a Bold tag in html,an italic tag should be there,and yes we can make
        the text loook italic using a em tag.The below is in italic text. 
    </p>
    <p><em>Italic text</em></p>
    <p>As like the <strong>Bold text </strong>we can make text look <em>italic text </em> in a paragraph.</p>
    <p>
        The Another intresting thing is wecan also write comments in a Html page
        so that other developers can read them.the comments are written
        <!-- in these brackets-->.
        I know you can't see above thing in a browser because it's a comment.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Lists</strong> are everywhere in programming languages.</p>
    <p>we can create an ordered list as well as an Unordered list using the tags.
        For an Unordered list we use a <em>ul</em> tag and each item within the List
        is created using the <strong>li</strong> tag.The below is an Unordered list.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>something</li>
        <li>anything</li>
        <li>nothing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For any Orderd list we use <em>ol</em> tag.Inside the ordered list tag we write our elements.
        The Below is an Ordered list.This ordered list gives the Number representation to the elements.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>something</li>
        <li>anything</li>
        <li>nothing</li>
    </ol>
