    <h1>Homepage</h1>
    <p>A web page contains a lot of elements,but not just a piease of text.
        It contains a lot of hyperlinks within the page.
        To create a link in the page we use a tag named <strong>anchor</strong> tag.
    </p>
    <a>TouchMe!</a>
    <p>The above one won't do any thing.You can believe me it's a hyperlink.
        So to create a link which does some work we have to use the <em>href</em> attribute
        in the anchor tag.The below one is a Hyperlink which will redirect you to
        a youtube Video.
    </p>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8&t">Watch Now!</a>
    <p>If you to add a link which contains information page which is not a part of internet.
        I created an about page which is a <em>html</em> file.You can see it below.
    </p>
    <a href="pages/about.html">About Page!</a>
