# git_test
A new Journey Begins Now!
This is a README ME! file which will contain what this repository was.
This git_test repository contains some html and css files in it.
I'm learning the full stack development using the opensource project named #odinproject.
So you can see the files in this repository gets changed from day to day(not so much).
Suggestions are always allowed for me as i'm a begginer.
